# Simplified Vircon32 emulator

This is a barebones version of the Vircon32 emulator, with just enough functionality for the basic console emulation. This version is not intended to be used to play! Use the regular emulator for that, since it includes GUI, configurable controls, etc.
    
The main purpose of the simplified emulator is demonstrate how to implement the core logic of the console by having a more clear source code, to make it easier to follow. By removing all unneeded features it is easier to focus on understanding how console components work.
